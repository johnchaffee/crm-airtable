# crm-airtable
 
Sample CRM that runs in browser and uses Airtable as a database. Can be embedded in Flex CRMcontainer.

In order to fetch data from Airtable, you must store the following variables as cookies:

- `airtableApiKey` - Your Airtable API Key
- `airtableBaseId` - Your Aitable Base ID

If those varialbes are not present, default sample contacts will be rendered instead.
